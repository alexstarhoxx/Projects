# Things that you learned
* java.util.Date: Date(long date) constructor.
* java.security.MessageDigest -> SHA-1 hashing
* java switch-case
* String object's method: o.isBlank()
* Traverse a list, should consider if the list is null first,
then use enhanced for structure to iterate!
* updateblob -> bug first, be careful to fall the trap of pointing one object!
* Key to finish this program more easily: Consider Persistence Structure first!
* Write relating persistence helper methods is very a goooood idea!!!!
* Try to understand what "untracked files" means
* The validity of -- should be done.
* If you have renamed a file and the file will be pushed
  just use git mv [file name], and then push.
